## Hello there 👋

We are a project created with the objective of teaching about programming in a simple and easy way and even contribute to open-source community. In fact, we've been doing this since **October 6, 2022**. That's when we created our first Discord bot, the first draft of our dear **Nagini** 🐍. Since then we've spreaded across the internet, creating our own [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/anticodingcodingclub/) where we share our interest with the whole world and also our [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@anticodingcodingclub) channel, which was probably your first contact with us.

### 🍿 An interconnected community

The open source community is the 💗 heart of Anti Coding Coding Club and fundamental to how we share knowledge today. That said our members:

- Always seek to contribute to open-source community;
- Seek the best concepts of technologies to produce amazing tutorials;

Now that we are talking about the important things ☝️, are you contributing to open-source? Yes? Okay, you rock! 🎸 If not, we can help you get started! Open source software is made by people just like you. There is how we started our [journey](https://opensource.guide/).
