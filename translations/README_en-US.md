## Hello there 👋

**🌎 README available in other languages:  [🇧🇷](/README.md)**

We are a project created with the aim of contributing to the open source community. In fact, we've been doing this since **October 6, 2022**. That's when we created our first bot for Discord, the first draft of our dear **Nagini** 🐍.
Since then we have spread across the internet, creating our own [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/anticodingcodingclub/) where we share our interest with the whole world and also our channel on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@anticodingcodingclub), where you probably met us.

### 🍿 An interconnected community

The open source community is the heart 💗 of the Anti Coding Coding Club and fundamental to how we share knowledge today. That said, our members:

- Always seek to contribute to the open source community;
- Seek the best technology concepts to produce incredible codes;

Now that we're talking about the important stuff ☝️, are you contributing to open source? Yes? Ok, you rock 🎸! If not, we can help you get started! Open source software is made by people like you. This is how we started our [journey](https://opensource.guide/).
